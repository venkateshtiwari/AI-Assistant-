AI-Assistant-
I have been working over a project in python for a few days and now I have successfully created an AI Assistant and I proudly celebrate this day by making the code public. So that anyone could easily use that. It is also available in two voices i.e. one male and the other female. You can go to my YouTube channel and know the journey of this project and many others.T
The code has been given in this repository.

The modules required for the project are as follows:
-pyttsx3
-wikipedia
-pyaudio
-SpeechRecognition

You can install these from the command prompt of windows or terminal if you are using Visual Studio Code or Pycharm by typing-
For e.g. pip install pyttsx3 

Then you can copy the code either form here or my youtube channel named codepoint but please also subscribe my channel and like the videos.

*POINTS TO NOTE:

-You can change the MASTER and use your name of choice whereever my name i.e. Venkatesh is given.
-You can change the voice of the assistant using either 1 or 0 in the 17 line of the code i.e. engine.setProperty('voice',voices[1].id)
-Please use your own E-mail and password where you are asked to in the 54th line of the code i.e. server.login('enter your email here','enter your password here')
-Please change the path to the apps which are given by default because they might vary in your computer.
-You can customise the code according to your need by changing the names of the assistant, by changing the messages, repies etc., by adding more apps to the code, and adding more features to the code.
-Lastly please subscribe to my Youtube channel like, share and comment on the videos and please tell if you can add a good feature to the assistant.
