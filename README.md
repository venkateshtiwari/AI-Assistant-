AI-Assistant-
I have been working over a project in python for a few days and now I have successfully created an AI Assistant and I proudly celebrate this day by making the code public. So that anyone could easily use that. It is also available in two voices i.e. one male and the other female. You can go to my YouTube channel and know the journey of this project and many others.T
The code has been given in this repository.

The modules required for the project are as follows:
-pyttsx3
-wikipedia
-pyaudio
-SpeechRecognition

You can install these from the command prompt of windows or terminal if you are using Visual Studio Code or Pycharm by typing-
For e.g. pip install pyttsx3
